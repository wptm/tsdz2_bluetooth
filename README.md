This is here a basic schematic. R1 and R2 is a voltage divider. We need this because TSDZ2 controller works on 5v logic level but HC-05 is 3.3v.

The voltage regulator makes lots heat. Therefore you can also build it into the housing and connect it directly to the controller board. There you can find +5v as well the uart rx/tx.
